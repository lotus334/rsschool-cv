I want to write clean code with clear architectural solutions. I consider sociability, efficiency and flexibility to be my advantages. 

Technologies: HTML, CSS (SCSS), JavaScript (jQuery), Java (Spring Boot, JDBC, jUnit 4), Gradle, Maven, Git.

You can find code examples on my github page.

I got a job in the S—Årile team as a junior full stack developer in the beginning of 2020. I use Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and jQuery) at work. The server part of the pages is written in jsp. It is a combination of java and html. The backend is respectively in java and MySQL. I write the code in Intellij IDEA.


During my training, I took the following courses:

Now I assess my level of English as intermediate.
