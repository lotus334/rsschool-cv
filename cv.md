I want to write clean code with clear architectural solutions. I consider sociability, efficiency and flexibility to be my advantages. 

**Technologies:**
* **HTML, CSS (SCSS)**
* **JavaScript (jQuery)** 
* **Java (Spring Boot, JDBC, jUnit 4)**
* **Gradle, Maven, Git**

You can find code examples on [**my github page**](https://github.com/lotus334).

I got a job in the Sсrile team as a **junior full stack developer in the beginning of 2020**. I use Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and jQuery) at work. The server part of the pages is written in jsp. It is a combination of java and html. The backend is respectively in java and MySQL. I write the code in Intellij IDEA.

During my training, I took the following courses:
- [x] [ 6.00.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python ](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/54b7ab1f1af14e6b8048a1685bf54990)
- [x] [Введение в Linux](https://stepik.org/cert/333093)
- [x] [Программирование на Python](https://stepik.org/cert/318718)
- [ ] [JavaScript Development (Rolling Scopes School and EPAM)](https://rs.school/)
- [ ] [Java-разработчик](https://praktikum.yandex.ru/java-developer/)

Now I assess my level of English as **intermediate**.
